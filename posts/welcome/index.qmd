This is the first post on a brand new blog site: welcome!

![](thumbnail.jpg)

After a while of getting (minorly) frustrated with the code-integration available for a Jekyll-based blog, I'm making the switch to one that's based on [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), the document and website preparation software tool that supports executable chunks in Python, R, and other-languages.

In getting this setup, [this post](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html) by Albert Rapp has been especially useful. A while ago, I did a post on [three ways to blog](../three-ways-to-blog-with-code/index.qmd), which at that time were Jupyter (with [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/) to markdown with execution), [codebraid](https://github.com/gpoore/codebraid), and R markdown--none of which were perfect. Quarto takes what was good about R markdown and makes it cross-language plus a bit better.[^a]

There are *tons* of nice features of blogging with Quarto, but one that's particularly useful for me is being able to have proper citations, like @turrell2013monte. And the support for executable code plus output figures--in multiple languages--is more or less unparalled.

[^a]: Though it's still based on the fantastic [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
